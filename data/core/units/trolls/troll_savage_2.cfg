    description= _ "As troll brats age, they grow more tusks and run faster. To everyone else's dismay. They often end up ripping appart their nannies, also refered to as trainers. This role is usually assigned to those who break trollish laws. No one really knows what are those, but at least the punishment for violating them is well-known."
